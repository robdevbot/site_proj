      <h2>French and English</h2>
      <p>I began studying French because I enjoy etymology, the study of word origins. Many words in English come from French.</p>
      
      <p>Here are a few French words commonly seen in English usage:</p>
      
      <ul class="frenchy">
        <li>Bourgeois</li>
        <li>Souvenir</li>
        <li>Mirage</li>
        <li>Cul-de-Sac</li>
        <li>Encore</li>
        <li>Genre</li>
      </ul>
      
      Some other words, like <span class="frenchy">coup</span> or <span class="frenchy">entree</span>, are used in English but have different meanings than their French counterparts.

      <h2>French on About.com</h2>
      <p>On my site, I try to give an overview of the French language. There are many sites out there with a lot more information. About.com has <a href="http://french.about.com/">a page all about French.</a></br>
      This site is great because it features a lot of resources and information. It also has feature articles that are added regularly. While it doesn't provide much of a personal touch, this website is ideal for most people interested in getting to know the French language better.
